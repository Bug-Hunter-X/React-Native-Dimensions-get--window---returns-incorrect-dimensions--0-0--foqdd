This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The `Dimensions.get('window')` method returns incorrect dimensions, often reporting zero values or values that don't match the actual screen size. This commonly happens when accessing dimensions before the component has fully mounted or when the layout is still being calculated. It might manifest as elements not rendering correctly, being positioned incorrectly, or not fitting the screen properly.
